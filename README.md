# Bufshow, A simple presentation tool for Emacs

Bufshow is a very simple global minor mode for Emacs.  Using an
external elisp file you define a set of "slides" which are nothing
more than files and rules on how to narrow buffers showing them.

Special support is provided for some types of files, for example
`org-mode` buffers can be narrowed to a sub-tree.

For more information see the documentation strings for the
`bufshow-mode` and `bufshow-start` functions.
